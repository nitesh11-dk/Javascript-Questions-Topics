Got it! Here's the updated version with the alternative names directly after the topic:

### Event Bubbling / Bubbling Phase / Event Propagation
- **Definition**: When an event occurs on an element, it first runs on that element and then propagates upward to its parent elements.

### Event Capturing / Capturing Phase / Event Trickle
- **Definition**: The event starts from the root of the DOM and trickles down to the target element, meaning the parent events run first before the child events.

### Event Delegation / Delegated Event Handling / Parent-Child Event Handling
- **Definition**: A technique where a single event listener on a parent element manages events for all its child elements, improving performance and simplifying code.
